# Architecture Flow (stakeholder walkthrough)

**One line:** synthetic bank/crypto data flows through a deterministic rules
engine, gets a bounded AI-assisted read, is merged with a full investigation
case file, and lands in a single standalone HTML page where a human analyst
makes and records the final call. Nothing is auto-closed by the AI — every
decision is a person clicking a button, and that click is what gets written
to the audit trail.

| Stage | Script / artifact | Input | Output | Who owns this in production |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Data ingestion | `generate_data.py` | — (synthetic generator) | `data/*.csv` | Core-banking / crypto-custodian data feeds (batch or streaming) |
| 2. Detection engine | `rules_engine.py` | `data/*.csv` | `output/alerts.json` | AML detection / compliance engineering (deterministic, explainable rules) |
| 3. AI copilot | `ai_copilot.py` | `output/alerts.json` | `output/alerts_with_ai.json` | AI/ML platform team — bounded, auditable score adjustment only |
| 4. Case file assembly | `enrich_ui_data.py`, `generate_investigation_data.py` | `output/alerts_with_ai.json`, `data/*.csv` | `output/alerts_for_ui.json`, `output/investigation_data.json` | Case-management / backend team |
| 5. UI build | `build_investigation_ui.py` | outputs of stage 4 + rule catalog | `output/case_review_ui.html` | Front-end/UX — currently a static build step, would become a live web app |
| 6. L1 analyst review | `output/case_review_ui.html` | itself (standalone) | staged disposition | L1 AML analyst (human-in-the-loop, final decision-maker) |
| 7. Audit trail | written client-side by the UI | analyst's submitted decision | `L1_Audit_tracker.csv` | Compliance/audit — system-of-record for every decision made |

## Why this shape matters for stakeholders

- The AI never decides anything on its own — it only adjusts a deterministic
  score within a fixed ±10 band and explains itself; a human always closes,
  escalates, or requests more information.
- Every stage's output is a plain JSON/CSV file, so each step can be
  inspected, replayed, or swapped out independently (e.g. point stage 1 at a
  real core-banking extract without touching stages 2–7).
- The whole thing runs with **zero infrastructure** — no database, no
  server, no deployment — which is exactly why it's fast to demo end-to-end,
  and also exactly what changes first when moving toward production (see
  below).

## Current vs. legacy build path

`README.md` documents `build_ui.py` / `ui_template.html` as the original,
simpler pipeline (alert queue + AI copilot + disposition only). The
canonical build used to produce today's `output/case_review_ui.html` is
`build_investigation_ui.py` / `investigation_template.html`, which layers
the full L1 investigation workspace (KYC/CDD, 12-month transaction analysis,
screening, red flags, system recommendation, audit trail, SLA tracker) on
top of that same original flow. See `INVESTIGATION_WORKSPACE.md` for how
the two relate.

```bash
python3 generate_data.py               # -> data/customers.csv, accounts.csv, transactions.csv, customer_profile_updates.csv
python3 rules_engine.py                # -> output/alerts.json
python3 ai_copilot.py                  # -> output/alerts_with_ai.json
python3 enrich_ui_data.py              # -> output/alerts_for_ui.json
python3 generate_investigation_data.py # -> output/investigation_data.json
python3 build_investigation_ui.py      # -> output/case_review_ui.html
```

Then open `output/case_review_ui.html` in a browser. No build step at
runtime, no server — everything (data + logic) is embedded in the single
HTML file. (An internet connection is needed once, when the page loads, for
the Bootstrap/Chart.js CDNs; if unreachable, tables and KPI cards still
render — only the charts and accordion animation are affected.)

## Extending this into something closer to production

- Swap `generate_data.py`'s output for a real (masked/synthetic)
  core-banking + crypto-custodian extract with the same schema.
- Persist alerts, profile-update events, and analyst decisions to a real
  database instead of JSON/CSV files, and expose the case-review UI through
  a backend (FastAPI is a natural fit given `ai_copilot.py` is already
  plain Python). A backend would also remove the current reliance on each
  analyst's local browser (File System Access API) for the audit file.
- Wire R04/R07/R10 to real exchange/custody APIs for wallet attribution
  (exchange-hosted vs. unhosted) rather than the synthetic `wallet_type`
  flag used here.
- Add a feedback loop job that periodically reviews analyst overrides to
  suggest rule threshold tuning.
- Layer in SAR (Suspicious Activity Report) drafting assistance once a case
  is escalated, using the same summary the copilot already generates.
- Add role-based access control and a full audit log store (who viewed
  what, when, and what the AI showed them at the time) — expected by bank
  compliance/audit functions even for a pilot.
