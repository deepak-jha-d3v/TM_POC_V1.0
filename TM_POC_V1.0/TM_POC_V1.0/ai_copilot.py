ai_copilot.py
-------------
Takes one alert (rule hits + evidence, produced by rules_engine.py) and asks
Claude to act as an L1 analyst copilot: adjust/explain the confidence score,
restate the triggered rules in plain language, write a short summary, and
suggest a next action.

Design principle: the LLM does NOT invent the base score from nothing. The
rules engine already computed a deterministic, auditable base score from
rule weights. The LLM is only allowed to nudge that score within a small
band and must justify the nudge -- this keeps the number defensible to a
model-risk/compliance reviewer instead of being an opaque LLM guess.

This script calls the real Anthropic API if ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in the
environment. Otherwise it falls back to a deterministic mock responder so
the pipeline is runnable end-to-end without network/API access (useful for
demos and for this sandbox).

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are an AML transaction-monitoring copilot assisting a Level 1 (L1) \
analyst. You are given a rule-based alert: the customer, the deterministic \
rules that fired, their weighted evidence, and a rule-based base score (0-100, \
already calculated by a separate deterministic engine -- you do not recompute it \
from scratch).

Your job:
1. Propose a final confidence_score: the base score adjusted by AT MOST +/-10 \
points based on contextual factors (customer risk rating, prior alert history, \
whether multiple independent typologies co-occur). Write an adjustment_reason \
of 3-4 sentences that an L1 analyst or a compliance/model-risk reviewer could \
rely on: (a) name which specific contextual factors you weighed and how each one \
pushed the score up, down, or was considered but not weighted, (b) explicitly \
state the point delta and confirm it falls within the +/-10 band, and (c) explain \
in plain terms why that net effect makes the alert more or less likely to reflect \
genuine suspicious activity. Do not just restate the rule evidence -- that is \
covered separately in rules_explained.
2. For each triggered rule, write a one-sentence plain-language explanation an \
L1 analyst can read in a few seconds.
3. Write a 2-3 sentence summary of why this alert exists and what it suggests.
4. Recommend one suggested_action: "close_false_positive", "escalate_to_l2", \
or "request_more_info".
